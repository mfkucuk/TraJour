            Planning future journeys and being able to see past journeys has been a big issue for travellers. 
            There are a number of ways travelers can plan their journeys such as listing their travel locations; 
            however, these solutions are not convenient. Therefore we aim to create an application that will provide 
            all the necessary tools a traveler might need when organising their journeys.
