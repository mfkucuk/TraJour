Title: TraJour

Description: TraJour is an app that will be used by travelers to communicate with other travelers and keep track 
of their own journeys.This desktop application functions as a social media diary for travelers. The application consists 
of public and private features that not only allow users to plan their journeys but also share their travels with 
their friends. We are using JavaFX 11. For data persistency we are using MySQL and for the map we are using WorldMapView
from ControlsFX This text file is a report that conveys our current status, what we have done so far, what will our future steps 
going to be, and the roles each group member played in the process.

Current Status and What Remains to Be Done:Except the oncoming small adjustments on the graphical user interface to make it better, 
the colorway, the button alignments, and the design has been completed. FXML files are created and are linked to the related code. 
A map has been implemented and it is going to have two new features which are distance calculating between the selected countries 
and map will show the capital cities on the map. The database that has been implemented is MySQL. This database makes it possible 
for a user to register and assigns each user a key. The login, logout, register, change password functions are working properly. 
Adding friends is possible as well and the main page has a feed section. Feed is showing users friends’ journeys and ratings. 
On profile page the user has a friends list and it will soon be implementing friends’ past journeys.
